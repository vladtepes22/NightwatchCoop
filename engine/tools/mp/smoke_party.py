"""Post-merge party smoke test: a fixed ~15-20 min 3-player scenario with an automatic verdict.

  python tools/mp/smoke_party.py [--root DIR] [--build DIR] [--game DIR] [--out DIR] [--phase s1,s2]
  python tools/mp/smoke_party.py --check-only --out DIR     (verdict again from the saved logs)

Mandatory after every merge to master (agents/RULES_062.txt). Runs through tools/mp/instances.py
(the shared game queue; 3 players: host and guest 1 rendered, guest 2 headless-lite; 127.0.0.1,
the instance root's own port range, muted, background windows, BB_DLSS=0), the default test save
(E:\\games\\bbport\\test_saves\\savedata, fresh copy each phase), timed screenshots of both rendered
games (tools/mp/shot.py --every) and a PASS / FAIL per step from the logs.

Phase s1 (~8 min, Father Gascoigne un-killed: the d10 fixture flags cleared on every save):
  join (3 players), Leave + Rejoin (Party page), a guest's death and its bloodstain, a party lamp
  travel to the Tomb of Oedon, a guest-started Gascoigne fight (intro on everyone), the host's death
  in the fight (limbo + spectate), the two guests' deaths (a wipe: the party's one respawn load).
Phase s2 (~8 min, the Cleric Beast un-killed: the b2_seamless 6.7 fixture flags):
  join, a party lamp travel to the Cleric Beast's lamp, the fight, the boss killed by the host
  (echoes and the reward item box on every game: its OK row), Leave + Rejoin right after the
  kill (A3 / K10b), a guest crash and its title rejoin (C6), the host's crash and recovery (the
  guests wait, then are summoned back), the host's Leave (every guest home).

Test aids used (it is a smoke, not real play): BB_PARTY_DIRECTOR_TEST steps (lamp warps, moves into
the boss trigger, scripted deaths, the boss kill, Party > Leave / Rejoin presses),
BB_PARTY_PROGRESS_TEST_CLEAR (boss fixtures), BB_PARTY_TEST_INVINCIBLE (players moved into a fight
live until their scripted death), instances.py --crash-plan (process kills).

Output: OUT/<phase>/shots/*.png, OUT/<phase>/inst{0,1,2}.log (this run's part of each run.log),
OUT/verdict.txt (one line per step: PASS / FAIL, the evidence line or what was missing, timings).
Exit code 0 only when every step passed. LOOK AT THE SCREENSHOTS too (agents/RULES_062.txt): the
verdict reads logs, it cannot see a grey screen, a camera in a wall or a stuck dialog.
